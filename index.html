        The other day was very stressful.<strong> The most stressful.</strong><em> That kind of stressful.</em> 
        I realized that my medication would not be here in time. <strong>You know...<em> that kind of stress.</em></strong>
        So naturally I did the only thing I knew how to do. <em>Freak the <strong> HELL</strong> out.</em>

        <u>Number Seven: Relative Absolute URL </u>
    </h1>
        <p>The absolute URL is not a flexible source. It's there and it won't change. 
           The relative URL is named and sourced and there is a level of control to change. 
           It also shows where the source is located and will live until altered.
           The absolute will always have the domain source name whereas the relative can be changed.</p>

    <p>The background positon makes the box that surrounding the image crop in the center. 
        Size and repeat make it so if the imsge is not big enough for the box, 
        it can not repeat or change size, or make it relative to the box.
        They cause a visual change when they are aligned in different formats, in this case centered.</p>
